  <b>Lyrics:</b><br>
🌷•Everybody's laughing in my mind <br>
🌷•Rumors spreading 'bout this other guy <br>
🌷•Do you do what you did when you did with me? <br>
🌷•Does he love you the way I can? <br>
🌷•Did you forget all the plans that you made with me? <br>
🌷•'Cause baby, I didn't <br>
 <hr>
🌷•That should be me, holding your hand <br>
🌷•That should be me, making you laugh (yeah) <br>
🌷•That should be me, this is so sad <br>
🌷•That should be me <br>
🌷•That should be me (ooh) <br>
🌷•That should be me, feeling your kiss (feeling your kiss)<br>
🌷•That should be me, buying you gifts (buying you gifts) <br>
🌷•This is so wrong <br>
🌷•I can't go on (I can't go on) <br>
'🌷•Til you believe <br>
🌷•That that should be me <br>
🌷•That should be me (no) <br>

🌷•You said you needed a little time from my mistakes <br>
🌷•It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced <br>
🌷•Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?<br>
🌷•What you doin' to me <br>
🌷•You're taking him where we used to go <br>
🌷•Now if you're tryna break my heart <br>
🌷•It's working 'cause you know <br>
 <hr>

🌷•That should be me <br>
 <hr>
🌷•I need to know (I need to know) should I fight (should I fight) for love (for love) <br>
🌷•Or disarm <br>
🌷•It's getting harder to shield (to shield) <br>
🌷•This pain in my heart, woo, yeah-yeah <br>
