<b>Lyrics:</b><br>
🌟•There I was again tonight <br>
🌟•Forcing laughter, faking smiles <br>
🌟•Same old tired, lonely place <br>
🌟•Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy <br>
🌟•Vanished when I saw your face <br>
🌟•All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you <br>
<br>
🌟•Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?" <br>
🌟•'Cross the room your silhouette <br>
🌟•Starts to make its way to me <br>
🌟•The playful conversation starts <br>
🌟•Counter all your quick remarks <br>
🌟•Like passing notes in secrecy <br>
<br>
🌟•And it was enchanting to meet you <br>
🌟•All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you <br>
<br>
🌟•This night is sparkling, don't you let it go <br>
🌟•I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home <br>
🌟•I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br>
🌟•I was enchanted to meet you <br>
<br>
🌟•The lingering question kept me up <br>
🌟•2 AM, who do you love? <br>
🌟•I wonder 'til I'm wide awake <br>
🌟•And now I'm pacing back and forth <br>
🌟•Wishing you were at my door <br>
🌟•I'd open up and you would say, "Hey" <br>
<br>
🌟•It was enchanting to meet you <br>
🌟•All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you <br>
<br>
🌟•This night is sparkling, don't you let it go <br>
🌟•I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home <br>
🌟•I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br>
🌟•That this night is flawless, don't you let it go <br>
🌟•I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone <br>
🌟•I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br>
🌟•I was enchanted to meet you <br>
<br>
🌟•This is me praying that <br>
🌟•This was the very first page <br>
🌟•Not where the story line ends <br>
🌟•My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again <br>
🌟•These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon <br>
🌟•I was enchanted to meet you <br>
🌟•Please don't be in love with someone else <br>
🌟•Please don't have somebody waiting on you <br>
🌟•Please don't be in love with someone else <br>
🌟•Please don't have somebody waiting on you <br>
<br>
🌟•This night is sparkling, don't you let it go <br>
🌟•I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home <br>
🌟•I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br>
🌟•This night is flawless, don't you let it go <br>
🌟•I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone <br>
🌟•I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br>
🌟•I was enchanted to meet you <br>
<br>
🌟•Please don't be in love with someone else <br>
🌟•Please don't have somebody waiting on you <br>
